VERCEL DEPLOYMENT GUIDE
=======================

This guide explains how to deploy the Annor Yeboah Care Foundation website to Vercel.

PREPARATION COMPLETED:
---------------------
✅ Created vercel.json configuration file
✅ Updated package.json with proper build script
✅ Created .vercelignore to exclude unnecessary files
✅ Verified all static assets are in place

DEPLOYMENT STEPS:
----------------

1. PREREQUISITES:
   - Install Vercel CLI: npm i -g vercel
   - Create a Vercel account at https://vercel.com
   - Ensure you have Git repository access

2. DEPLOY VIA VERCEL CLI:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to project directory
   cd "c:\Users\Nana Opoku\Downloads\Music\NGO"
   
   # Login to Vercel (first time only)
   vercel login
   
   # Deploy the project
   vercel
   
   # Follow the prompts:
   # - Set up and deploy? [Y/n] Y
   # - Which scope? (select your account)
   # - Link to existing project? [y/N] N
   # - What's your project's name? annor-yeboah-care-foundation
   # - In which directory is your code located? ./
   ```

3. DEPLOY VIA VERCEL DASHBOARD:
   - Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your Git repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect the configuration
   - Click "Deploy"

4. CUSTOM DOMAIN (Optional):
   - In Vercel dashboard, go to your project
   - Navigate to Settings > Domains
   - Add your custom domain (e.g., annoryeboahcare.org)
   - Follow DNS configuration instructions

CONFIGURATION DETAILS:
---------------------

The vercel.json file includes:
- Static site build configuration
- URL routing (/ redirects to /Home.html)
- Clean URLs (removes .html extension)
- Security headers (XSS protection, frame options, etc.)
- Caching rules for static assets
- 301 redirect from /index.html to /Home.html

IMPORTANT NOTES:
---------------
- The site will be deployed as a static site (no server-side rendering)
- All HTML files are self-contained and don't require server processing
- Images and assets are optimized for web delivery
- The custom Node.js server (js/server.js) is excluded from deployment
- Social media and email links are properly configured

TESTING:
--------
After deployment:
1. Test the main navigation between pages
2. Verify all images load correctly
3. Check that contact links (phone/email) work
4. Test social media links in footer
5. Ensure responsive design works on mobile

TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------
- If images don't load: Check file paths are relative and case-sensitive
- If pages return 404: Verify HTML files are in root directory
- If styles don't apply: Check CSS file paths in HTML files
- If deployment fails: Check .vercelignore doesn't exclude required files

ENVIRONMENT:
-----------
- Node.js version: 18 (as specified in configuration)
- Build command: Static site (no build process needed)
- Output directory: Root directory (.)
- Framework: Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript
